# Best-Buy-Customer-Recommendation-Worksheet
This is a proof of concept for Best Buy's customer recommendation worksheet coded in Java.

I wrote this app to show a more effective way of actually delivering content to customers.

I wrote this in Java and was planning on making a web interface for it as well as an Android app.

It will take a Customer Recommendation Worksheet and email it to the customer based on their preferences
in the finished product.

Few things to note:

1) Does not actually email a pdf because the 'submit' button does not work.
2) Logging in has no effect.
3) You cannot save a CRW.
4) You cannot download a saved CRW.
